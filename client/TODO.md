### Core Typing Logic

- [ ] Implement user input handling in the `Typer` component.
- [ ] Add logic to compare user input against the target words and highlight correctness.
- [ ] Implement a timer for the typing test.
- [ ] Calculate and display Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy in the `Result` component.
- [ ] Create a state management system (e.g., using Context or a library) to handle the game state (waiting, in-progress, finished).

### Routing and Pages

- [ ] Integrate `react-router-dom` to create a single-page application structure.
- [ ] Create routes for the main pages: Home (Typing Test), Login, Sign Up, About, and User Profile/Dashboard.
- [ ] Protect user-specific routes so they are only accessible after login.

### UI/UX Enhancements

- [ ] Add a project favicon.
- [ ] Make the on-screen keyboard interactive, highlighting keys as the user types.
- [ ] Implement theme switching using the `ThemeContext`.
